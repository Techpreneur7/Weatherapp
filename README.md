## 2. Setup & Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoinaRavikiran/Weatherapp.git
cd Weatherapp
Install dependencies:

npm install


Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap
.

Create a file src/apiKeys.js:

const apiKeys = {
  base: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
  key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
};

export default apiKeys;
Start the development server:

npm start


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

3. Running Test Cases

Currently, no pre-written test cases exist. To add tests:

Install testing dependencies (if not installed):

npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react


Run the test suite:

npm test


You can write tests for components like Forcast.js to test rendering, API calls, and dropdown functionality.

4. Assumptions & Design Choices

City search suggestions are fetched when input length â‰¥ 3 characters to avoid unnecessary API calls.

Default city is set to Delhi on initial load.

Dropdown suggestions show city, country using OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API.

Separate apiKeys.js file is used to store API keys and is ignored in .gitignore.

Responsive design: works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Animated weather icons used via ReactAnimatedWeather for better user experience.
